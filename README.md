dxLib
======

Delphi 5 - Delphi XE+ general purpose library of routines.
Currently Win32 and Win64 platforms

*NOTE* Since it's been a number of years since I have had to deal with Delphi 5, there is little point for me to maintain this library going forward and it has been archived.

Some of this code (TdxThread for certain) will be further maintained in https://github.com/ideasawakened/iaLib
